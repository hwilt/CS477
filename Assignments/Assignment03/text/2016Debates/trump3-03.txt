Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that would go back to the individual states.

If they overturned it, it would go back to the states.

If we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that is really what will happen. That will happen automatically in my opinion. Because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. I will say this. It will go back to the states and the states will then make a determination.
