The ethics and implications of AI-powered creativity?


specificalty talking about music/art forms

Is the output of an AI model (specifically music/art) yours, the models', the art that the model is trained on, or the people who created the model? I would like to take a dive into the where should the credit of the output lay. Which leads to many questions but one other I would like to focus on is AI a tool like garage band or is AI a person. Another topic that should be explored, the effect of how people who have disabilities use AI to be creative.
