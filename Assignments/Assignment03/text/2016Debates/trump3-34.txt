But I just have too... It’s so ridiculous what she… she will defeat ISIS. We should never have let ISIS happen in the first place. And right now they are in 32 countries --

Wait one second. They had a cease-fire three weeks ago. A ceasefire: United States, Russia, Syria. And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swathes of land and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore. We are so outplayed on missiles, on ceasefires. They are outplayed. She wasn't there. I assume she had nothing to do with it, but our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad and, by the way, and by Iran. Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.
