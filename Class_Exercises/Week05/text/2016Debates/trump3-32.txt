Which is a big mistake

It's a catastrophe.

It’s a mess. Have you seen it? Have you seen it? Have you seen what’s happened to Aleppo?

Okay, so it hasn’t fallen.Take a look at it.

That’s right. And they are being slaughtered because of bad decisions.

Well Aleppo is a disaster. It’s a humanitarian nightmare, but it has fallen from any standpoint. What do you need, a signed document? Take a look at Aleppo. It is so sad when you see what's happened. And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton. Because what's happened is by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought -- now she's going to say oh he loves Assad. He's much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama. And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago. He aligned with Russia. He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful. We gave them $150 billion back. We gave them $1.7 billion in cash. I mean, cash, bundles of cash as big as this stage. We gave them $1.7 billion.
