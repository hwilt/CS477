# Questions and Answers:
- Did you work with a buddy? If so, who?
  - No I did not
- Are you submitting your heuristic to the class competition? If so, what name or pseudonym would you like to use on the class web site?
  - Yes and Henry is alright
- How long did this take you? I'm simply using this to gauge if things are too easy, too hard, or just right. 
  -  7 hours, the assignment was fun to work on and see the steps to get to the solution
- Any feedback to help improve the assignment for future students? Alternatively, if there's nothing you would change, let me know what specifically worked for you about it so I know to keep doing things like that.

## My Heuristic
It may not be great but it definitely is better than the blocking heursitic
H{0} = at the goal state
H{1} = red car has no cars in front of it
H{1+n} = where n is the number of cars in front of the red car
