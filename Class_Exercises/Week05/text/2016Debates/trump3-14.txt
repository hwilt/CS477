You can't.

Correct.

Over a 10-year period.

So I just left some high representatives of India. They're growing at 8%. China is growing at 7%. And that for them is a catastrophically low number. We are growing our last report came out, and it is right around the 1% level. And I think it’s going down. Last week as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report. A terrible jobs report. In fact, I said is that the last jobs report before the election? Because if it is, I should win easily because it was so bad. The report was so bad. Look, our country is stagnant. We've lost our jobs, we've lost our businesses. We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking. Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world. I've visited so many communities. This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris. I've gotten to know so many, I’ve developed so many friends over the last year. And they cry when they see what has happened. I pass factories that were thriving, 20, 25 years ago and because of the bill her husband signed and that she blessed 100%. It is just horrible what has happened to these people in these communities. Now, she can say her husband did well but boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in because it didn't really kick in very much. But it kicked in after they left. Boy, did they suffer. That was one of the worst things that has ever been signed by our country. Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership. And she wants it. She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates. She totally lied. She did call it the gold standard. And they actually fact checked and they said I was right.
