But it was a terrible recession. So now we've dug ourselves out of it. We're standing, but we're not yet running. So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out, and the ground up. Not the top down. That is not going to work. That is why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt. But it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher paying jobs. We're beginning to see some increase in incomes. And we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs. We have got to do more to get the whole economy moving and that's what I believe I will be able to do.
