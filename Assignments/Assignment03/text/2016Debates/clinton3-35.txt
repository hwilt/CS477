Well, first when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is "Make America Great Again." I wonder when he thought America was great. And before he rushes and says, you know, before you and President Obama were there, I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades. You know, back in 1987, he took out an $100,000 ad in the New York Times during the time when President Reagan was president and basically said exactly what he just said right now. That we were the laughing stock of the world. He was criticizing President Reagan. This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, you know, ‘I alone can fix it,’ as he said on the convention stage.
